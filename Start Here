# MachineLearning
To start python go through the most basic python topics listed below:
If you're new to data types, i reccomend trying "type()" on everything you use, wherever you save something just use a type() if you're unsure if its a list or an array (covered later, dont worry) or whatever else. That way you'll get more comfortable with basic data types and there's no real need to read about them specifically you'll get used to them as and when you apply them.
Integer: int = 2
Float: float = 2.2 (basically decimals)
Character: "a", "2" etc. Yes so 2 is an integer but "2" is a character, they're interpreted differently by your machine. Just something good to know.
Strings: All you need to know is that strings are a collection of characters.
Loops: Literally any basic python tutorial should have you covered, just read up about the if loop, for loop and while loop
Boolean Logic: Not used much, so I'll just cover it as and when we come to it.
